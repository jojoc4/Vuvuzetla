        Privacy Policy

        Last Updated: May 2022
        Privacy statement
        This privacy statement applies to the mobile app Vuvuzetla (the “App”) and Vuvuzetla websites (the “Website”). Both together are referred to as “Services”.
        1. General
        With regard to the Services, Vuvuzetla is the data controller in terms of the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”).
        This privacy statement provides information about how we collect and process personal data in connection with our Services.
        2. Access to and storage of information in terminal equipment
        By using our app, access to information (e.g. IP address) or storage of information (e.g. cookies) in your terminal equipment may occur. This access or storage may involve further processing of personal data pursuant to the GDPR.
        In cases where such access to information or such storage of information is strictly necessary for the technically error-free delivery of our services, this is done on the basis of § 25 para. 1 s. 1, para. 2 no. 2 TTDSG.
        In cases where such a process serves other purposes (e.g. the needs-based design of our app), this will only be carried out on the basis of § 25 para. 1 TTDSG with your consent pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR. The consent can be revoked at any time with effect for the future.
        For more information on the processing of your personal data and the relevant legal basis in this context, please refer to the following sections on the specific processing activities on our website.
        3. Data that we collect and process
        a. When fist using the app, we assign a random user number to your device to be able to identify you. This random device number enables us to assign the Vuvuzetla activities (messages and votes) to a device. The user number does not allow for any conclusion to be drawn about your identity or other personal data. The processed data will be only used in case of legal necessity (e.g. Criminal prosecution).
        b. We assign the following data to the user number and store them:
            Your interaction with the App, such as:
            - Your messages;
            - Your votes;
            - Your curent username ;
            Technical data transmitted by your mobile device, such as:
            - Your IP address;
            Data on the approximate location where the accuracy varies with the location service used by Apple and Google (Wlan, GPS, radio cell). Apple and Google will optimize themselves which approach will yield the best results in a given situation for the user with the least strain on the battery life. Vuvuzetla has no influence over this process.
        4. How and for what purpose we process data, and the legal basis of such processing
        a. Except in the cases mentioned below, we will only disclose personal data if and to the extent that we are required to do so by law or by court or administrative order. The legal basis for this is Art. 6 (1) lit. c GDPR (legal obligation).
        d. We process the above-mentioned data for the following purposes and in the following ways:
             Messages and votes: On the operation of the App, in particular on the presentation of the contents generated by you in the App; the legal basis for such processing is Art. 6 (1) lit. b GDPR (performance of a contract and pre-contractual measures);
            Technical data: To distinguish actual App users from bots, to prevent misuse and to block illegal content reported by other users; the legal basis for such processing is Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR (legitimate interests; legitimate interest in being able to distinguish users from bots, prevent misuse and block illegal content);
            Location data: To provide localised and location-based information in the App and thus ensure the full functionality of the App; the legal basis for such processing is Art. 6 (1) lit. a GDPR (your consent or voluntary information);
        8. Storage period for personal data
        Unless a shorter storage period is specified in this privacy statement, we will store personal data for as long as it is necessary to provide the Services to you; and/or it is necessary in view of the contractual relationship with you. Thereafter, the data will only be stored if and to the extent that we are obliged to do so by law. If we no longer need the relevant personal data for the purposes described above, these personal data will only be stored for the duration of the respective statutory retention obligations and will not be processed for other purposes.
